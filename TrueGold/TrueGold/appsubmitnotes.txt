App Store Submission Notes (True Gold)

1. Disable export compliance prompt:
   - TARGET → Info tab → Add property.
   - Key: App Uses Non-Exempt Encryption
   - Type: Boolean
   - Value: NO

2. Supported iOS Version:
   - Target: iOS 18.5 (cleanest for dev/testing, avoids iOS 17.x visual bug).

3. Screenshots & Preview Video
    •    Apple requires coverage for all device size classes, but will auto-scale from either 6.5″ or 6.9″ uploads.
    •    The preview video must be submitted under the 6.5″ slot (886 × 1920 px, portrait).
    •    If you upload 6.9″ screenshots, they do not satisfy the 6.5″ slot — you must also upload at least one 6.5″ screenshot alongside the video.
    •    It’s not fully clear whether Apple scales 6.5 → 6.9 or 6.9 → 6.5, so safest is to supply both 6.5″ and 6.9″ screenshots.
    •    If you record on iPhone 11 Pro Max (6.5″), the raw video fits the required size and avoids the ffmpeg scaling workaround.

4. ffmpeg (if scaling needed):
   ./ffmpeg -i Video.mp4 -f lavfi -i anullsrc=channel_layout=stereo:sample_rate=44100 -shortest -vf "scale=886:1920,setsar=1:1" -r 30 -c:v libx264 -crf 20 -preset slow -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -ac 2 -movflags +faststart -f mp4 Video_READY.mp4

5. App Store Connect Metadata:
   - Fill in App Name, Subtitle, Promotional Text, Description.
   - Add Keywords.
   - Upload App Icon and marketing screenshots.

6. Support & Privacy URLs:

7. Pricing:
   - Set Price Tier: Free ($0.00, USD). This auto-adjusts to SEK and other currencies.

8. Content Rights:
   - Select “No third-party content” (fetching API data does not count).

9. App Privacy:

✅ Correct way to set app icon as launch image (don't need storyboard):

    1. Go to target → Info tab.
    2. Expand **Launch Screen** (this is a Dictionary named `UILaunchScreen`).
    3. Add **Image Name** (this is the Xcode UI label; the underlying plist key is `UIImageName`).
    4. Type in "AppIcon" or alternative image in assets
    5. Optional: add **Background color** to match your icon.
    6. Done — no storyboard needed.
    7. I think must delete app and reinstall, but its fast, can't see.

    • If the image doesn’t show, create a normal Image Set in Assets (e.g., `LaunchImage`) and reference that instead of the App Icon set.
    • `UILaunchScreen` shows as a Dictionary by design; Xcode stores `UIImageName` under it.
    • Cold launches are fast; you may barely see it. That’s expected.

✅ Correct way to set app icon in settings (like True Blocker):

    Device cache is permanent and the app icon in settings will not change once built.
    iOS must update or Erase data to change the AppIcon.
    Or use another bundleID
    It works on other phones and even the AppStore even if you see empty graph icon
    
    Just do normal, single 1024x1024 in the host app and settings will take that icon.
