App Store Submission Notes (True Gold)  
1. Disable export compliance prompt:  
    1.1 TARGET → Info tab → Add property.  
    1.2 Key: App Uses Non-Exempt Encryption  
    1.3 Type: Boolean  
    1.4 Value: NO  

2. Supported iOS Version:  
    2.1 Target: iOS 18.5 (cleanest for dev/testing, avoids iOS 17.x visual bug).  

3. Screenshots & Preview Video  
    3.1 Apple requires coverage for all device size classes, but will auto-scale from either 6.5″ or 6.9″ uploads.  
    3.2 The preview video must be submitted under the 6.5″ slot → 886 × 1920 px (portrait) or 1920 × 886 (landscape).  
    3.3 No device records at these dimensions natively — you must scale/crop.  
    3.4 If you upload 6.9″ screenshots, they do not satisfy the 6.5″ slot — you must also upload at least one 6.5″ screenshot alongside the video.  
    3.5 Safest: supply both 6.5″ and 6.9″ screenshots.  

4. ffmpeg (for scaling app preview videos):  
    4.1 From an iPhone 11 Pro Max recording (1242×2688 portrait):  
        ffmpeg -i INPUT.mov -f lavfi -i anullsrc=channel_layout=stereo:sample_rate=44100 -shortest -vf “scale=-2:1920,crop=886:1920” -r 30 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -ac 2 OUTPUT_886x1920.mp4  
    4.2 Notes:  
        - Add silent audio track if missing, or Apple may reject.  
        - Landscape variant:  
            ffmpeg -i INPUT.mov -vf “scale=1920:-2,crop=1920:886” -r 30 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -ac 2 OUTPUT_1920x886.mp4  

5. App Store Connect Metadata:  
    5.1 Fill in App Name, Subtitle, Promotional Text, Description.  
    5.2 Add Keywords.  
    5.3 Upload App Icon and marketing screenshots.  

6. Support & Privacy URLs:  
    6.1 Point to GitHub Pages (https://tilo-karl.github.io/tg/).  

7. Pricing:  
    7.1 Set Price Tier: Free ($0.00, USD). This auto-adjusts to SEK and other currencies.  

8. Content Rights:  
    8.1 Select “No third-party content” (fetching API data does not count).  

9. App Privacy:  
    9.1 Fill in privacy questionnaire (App Privacy section).  

10. Age Rating:  
    10.1 Answer “No” to all restricted-content categories → Rated 4+.  

11. Platform Availability:  
    11.1 TURN OFF Apple Silicon Mac availability.  
    11.2 TURN OFF Apple Vision Pro availability.  
    11.3 Ship for iPhone (and iPad if acceptable).  

12. Export Compliance:  
    12.1 Do not pre-fill the encryption documentation modal.  
    12.2 Submit normally; Apple will ask export compliance during submission flow.  
    12.3 (Update: Apple did not ask any compliance question after clicking review button.)  

13. Launch Screen (no storyboard):  
    13.1 Target → Info tab.  
    13.2 Expand Launch Screen (UILaunchScreen dictionary).  
    13.3 Add Image Name (Xcode label; plist key = UIImageName).  
    13.4 Type AppIcon or another image in assets.  
    13.5 Optional: add background color.  
    13.6 Done. Cold launches are fast, you may barely see it.  

14. App Icon in Settings (True Blocker note):  
    14.1 Device cache is permanent and the app icon in settings won’t change once built.  
    14.2 iOS must update or erase data to change. Or use another bundle ID.  
    14.3 It works on other phones and the App Store even if you see empty graph icon.  
    14.4 Just do normal, single 1024×1024 in the host app.  

15. Uploading a New Version (App Store Connect quirks):  
    15.1 Increment version number if already on the App Store (e.g. from 1.0 → 1.1).  
    15.2 Reset build number back to 1 for each new version. If you resubmit the same version, increment build (1, 2, 3…).  
    15.3 After creating the new version in App Store Connect, fill in metadata (What’s New, Promo Text, Description, Keywords).  
    15.4 Click Save → this commits the default locale (English U.S.).  
    15.5 Screenshots/App Previews stay blocked with the red error “Please save new locales…” until BOTH steps are done:  
        15.5.1 Save the metadata at least once.  
        15.5.2 Attach a build under the Build section (Add Build). Apple requires a build before media uploads are accepted.  
    15.6 Workaround if uploads still blocked: open “View All Sizes in Media Manager,” then return — this refreshes the uploader.  
    15.7 Screenshots are per-device, but you only need them once (default locale). Apple reuses globally unless you add localizations.
